## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
I. Prerequisites

Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js version 18 or higher installed on your system.

npm or Yarn: You'll use npm (which comes with Node.js) to manage project dependencies.

MongoDB: You need a running MongoDB instance. This can be:

A local installation of MongoDB Community Server.

A cloud-based instance, such as a free tier cluster from MongoDB Atlas (recommended for easier setup).

II. Backend Setup

Project Folder Creation (if starting new):

First, create a main project folder (e.g., chat-app) in your desired location.

Enter this chat-app folder.

Inside chat-app, create a new folder named backend.

Navigate into the newly created backend folder.

Install Dependencies:

In your terminal, while in the backend folder, install all required Node.js packages.

Configure Environment Variables (.env file):

Create a file named .env directly within the backend folder.

Add the following variables to this .env file, replacing the bracketed placeholders with your actual details:

MONGO_DB_URI: Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/my_chat_db for local, or your Atlas URI).

PORT: The port your backend server will listen on (e.g., 5000).

JWT_SECRET: A strong, random secret key for JSON Web Token authentication.

NODE_ENV: Set this to development for local work.

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME: Your Cloudinary cloud name.

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: Your Cloudinary API key.

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET: Your Cloudinary API secret.

Run Backend Server:

Start the backend server. It should begin running on the port you specified (e.g., http://localhost:5000).

III. Frontend Setup

Project Folder Creation (if starting new):

From the backend folder, navigate back to your main chat-app project folder.

Inside chat-app, create a new folder named frontend.

Navigate into the newly created frontend folder.

Install Dependencies:

In your terminal, while in the frontend folder, install all required React and frontend packages.

Run Frontend Development Server:

Start the frontend development server. The chat application should automatically open in your web browser (typically at http://localhost:5173).

üåç Usage
  
  Register: Navigate to http://localhost:your_port/signup and create a new account.
  Login: Use your credentials to login.
  Chat: Select a user from the sidebar to start a conversation. Messages will appear in real-time.
